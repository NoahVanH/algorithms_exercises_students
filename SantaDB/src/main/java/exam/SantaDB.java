/**
 * Santa Claus is getting ready for his annual gift distribution.
 *
 * The Christmas elves have worked hard to compile a list of children and the gifts they wish to receive, as mentioned in their letters.
 * However, there's been a slight mix-up: the elves' list of gifts, collected from the children's letters, is missing the children's names.
 *
 * For instance, the lists of children and gifts might look something like this:
 * Children: [{1, "Alice"}, {2, "Bob"}, {3, "Charlie"}, {4, "Britney"}]
 * Gifts: [{1001, 1, "Toy Train"}, {1002, 1, "Doll"}, {1003, 2, "Bicycle"}]
 *
 * Note that not every child may have written a letter, and those children will not receive gifts.
 * Each child has a unique ID, and each gift is also tagged with the child's ID to whom it is intended.
 *
 * Your task is to assist Santa in matching each child with their respective gift(s) and generate a list of gift assignments like:
 * [{1, "Alice", 1001, "Toy Train"}, {1, "Alice", 1002, "Doll"}, {2, "Bob", 1003, "Bicycle"}]
 * This operation is known as an inner join in database terminology.
 *
 * This list will be extremely useful for Santa to prepare name stickers for the gifts.
 *
 * If 'n' is the number of children and 'm' is the number of gifts, your method's time complexity should be O(n log m).
 * You will earn 50% of the grade for a code that produces the correct result, and 100% if your code also meets the time complexity requirement.
